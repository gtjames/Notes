## Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX

> If you design for the smallest, least powerful decide first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. *Joel Marsh* #quote 

We cannot developer our design for computer only anymore. Since 2007, when Apple announced the iPhone, things have changed forever. 

### The Paradigm Shift
Computers: replaced every 4-5 
+ Usually shared by the household

Mobile devices: 1-2 years
+ Each person has its own device

The paradigm shift is that we went from one device per household to multiple devices per household.

Mobile traffic up 18.6% over 2013. 
This is the latest report of 2022:
> **Mobile accounts for approximately half of web traffic worldwide**. In the second quarter of 2022, mobile devices (excluding tablets) generated 58.99% of global website traffic, consistently hovering around the 50 percent mark since the beginning of 2017 before permanently surpassing it in 2020 *[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,permanently%20surpassing%20it%20in%202020.)*

Responsive Retrofitting: Taking what you have and making it work on mobile. Bad practice. 
Responsive *is not* Mobile first.
Issues with Responsive Retrofitting:
1. Doesn't address real estate issues
2. Doesn't address touch interaction issues

Mobile First ups and downs:
+ Time consuming and constly for a full rebuild
+ Provides best experience across many devices
+ Address constrains of mobile size/bandwith
+ Future friendly and ready for growth

#### Things to remember
1. Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011
2. You don't see people with their heads in laptops
3. Start small and scale up
4. Mobile is not a fad

## How to Improve UX by Understanding Users

> It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them. *Steve Jobs* #quote

How to know the users better than themselves: don't listen to what users say. See what they are doing.

Three things that can help

1. Be There
	+ To help move someone along their decision journey, and deepen their loyalty 
2. Be Useful
	+ Only 9% of users will stay if it doesn't satisfy ther needs. Provide for what they came for as quickly as possibile.
3. Be Quick
	+ Reduce cognitive load. Even a click less can make an incredible difference. It's not about fast loading, the functionality must be easy to find and use as well. Eccessive steps cause the client frustration and a bad experience.

### Be Reachable
75% of people rely solely on their thumbs & 49% use a one handed grip.

How can this information help us? Make sure to put buttons and call to actions in the area that is the most accessible from the thumb!

Tables will use two-handed grip. Plan for that.

### Speed Matters
How does this affect business?

+ Google -> 1/2 second delay = 20% drop in traffic
+ Bing -> 2 seconds delay = 4% drop in revenue
+ AOL -> Fastest 10% users stays 50% longer

Do not assume that everyone will have blazing fast network connections.

How to improve loading time:
1. Reduce image usage throughout sites/apps
2. Use SVG/Webfonts because they are much lower bandwith
3. Optimize and Minify CSS and JS files
4. GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data

## Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design

What can we do to make things better for everyone and make software more accessible?

### Primary Controls
Usually the menu is on the top which is the hardest part of a user to reach with their thumbs. If we move the navbar to the bottom of the screen we solve the issue.

Put the most used parts of your website where is easiest to reach them.
When primary controls are within easy reach:
1. Created perception of faster applications
2. Improved engagements rates because people used it more
3. Increased user satisfaction

## Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms
> The constraints of mobile push you toward mode focused, simplified solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have to wait for it, and they are unlikely to give you their full attention. So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first. ***Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity***. *Luke Wroblewski*

1. Have the label display inside the field so the input field can take up the whole space
2. Make the input field taller so the user can click on it more easily
3. Use float labels as well so the user can always remember what that field is for
4. Only asks for information that you really need. Less is more in this case! The lesser input fields, the more likely people to fill it out and send it over
5. Large checkboxes
6. Paginate the form - break it down into sections and possible have the forms move on to the next page (not a long form on one page only)
7. Show a progress indicator
8. Enable autocomplete on your forms
9. Make default option to show password and give them the option to hide it. Easier and less mistakes.
10. Ask for the right keyboard for the input they are entering
11. Do not list you phone number as text only. Instead use a `a` tag with `href="tel:8014356789"` so people can place a call directly

## Designing a Better Mobile Advertising UX
> End-users, not technology, shape the market. Consequently, marketers need to stay abreast not only of techonological developments but also of the way people respond to them. *Matt Haig*

If you want to put ads in your content, make them small and simple.
Make them expandable from the user input.

How to make better ads:
1. Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs
2. Keep it simple and sleek
3. Make sure it's unobstrusive.
4. Content first
